# apoliveira.github.io

This is the repo for my personal/academic website.

It's based on a Hyde theme with some minor tweaks.

## Generating CV

1. Include the appropriate .tex template and data in `_data/`.
2. Run `make` from the root folder (Note: this will generate the cv PDF and remove all "backgound data" used).

## Requirements

- npm
  - js-yaml
