I was born and raised in [New Rochelle, NY][newro] and received my Bachelor's degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science from [Manhattan College][mancol] in 2015. I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Mathematics at [Wesleyan University][wes].

While I no longer play Rugby, I was a member of the [White Plains RFC][wprfc] team and played for a number of years. I believe it's one of the most beautiful sports and think everyone should give it a [try][try] (pun intended)!

I also enjoy programming in my spare time (when it exists). Check out my projects on [GitHub][github].
