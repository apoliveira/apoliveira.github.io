I was born and raised in [New Rochelle, NY][newro] and received my Bachelor's degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science from [Manhattan College][mancol] in 2015. 
I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics at [Wesleyan University][wes] under the supervision of [Felipe Ram√≠rez][felipe] in May 2021. 

I'm currently a Data Science Intern at Travelers Insurance exploring and enjoying the Industry world.

I enjoy spending my time gardening, cycling, baking sourdough bread, and programming. Check out some of my projects on [GitHub][github].
