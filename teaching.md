### Some Useful Links

If you're interested in learning math on your own, like mind maps, but don't know where to start, I highly recommend giving [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz/mathematics) a look. It is a fully open source search engine, so you can also contribute back to the project. It also has mindmaps for a number of other subjects.

Another great resource for understanding different topics is [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math). It covers a wide range of material from Early Math to Calculus. Their [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4a-Gbdw7vOaccHmFo40b9g) is also a great help.

If instead you prefer perusing notes that work you through examples give [Paul's Online Math Notes](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/) a look!
