I firmly believe in [Federico Ardila-Mantilla's](http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/) axioms:

- Axiom 1. Mathematical talent is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

- Axiom 2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.

- Axiom 3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.

- Axiom 4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
