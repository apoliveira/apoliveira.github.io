Recently, I was at a Math conference for graduate students. I think I've taken away *some* new Math from it, but I was reminded of a very important lesson during a talk. It's an easy lesson to forget, which is why I'm writing it here as a reminder to myself and others.

The venue had these funny "scrollable" chalkboards for the talks. They were pieces of fabric with bars every couple feet for the user to grab and pull/push the fabric up and down; similar to sliding chalkboards but made of fabric and on a conveyer belt. Also, there was a rectangular hole underneath the portion of the board used for writing that one could push/pull the bar from if it was too high. This feature will be important.

During one of the talks, by a well-known mathematician, she had trouble reaching the bar to move to the next pane. This happened a few times; she would try to push the bar further up but to no avail. Eventually, the dutiful audience mentioned that she can use the hole under the board.
