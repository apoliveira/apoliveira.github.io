I'm currently reading/researching **Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems**, and their connections to **Number Theory**.

### Conferences Attended
- *Graduate Student Conference in Algebra, Geometry, and Topology*, Temple University, June 2017.
- *Upstate New York Number Theory Conference*, Binghamton University, May 2017.
- *2017 Joint Mathematics Meetings*, Atlanta, GA, January 2017.
- *2015 Joint Mathematics Meetings*, San Antonio, TX, January 2015.

### Research Experience
- This summer I am attending the [Polygonal Billiards Research Cluster][poly research] at Tufts University.
- During the summer of 2014, I participated in the [*Jasper Summer Fellow's* program][fellow]. I analyzed their Women’s Soccer team, the Jaspers, from a Network Theory perspective. We found strengths and weaknesses among the players using standard measures from Network Theory, and also quantified the similarity between the Jaspers and the 2010 Men’s World Cup Top 16 teams. This work lead to the following publication:
  - (with H. Tyler) [*Measurement and comparison of passing networks in collegiate soccer.*][paper] Minnesota Journal of Undergraduate Mathematics, [S.l.], v. 1, n. 1, Dec. 2015.
