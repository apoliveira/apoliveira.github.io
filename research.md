I'm currently reading/researching **Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems**, and their connections to **Number Theory**.

### Talks
- *A brief glance at Ergodic Theory*, Graduate Student Seminar, Wesleyan University, February 2017.
- *A look at the \$25,000,000,000 eigenvector*, Graduate Student Seminar, Wesleyan University, October 2016.
- *Defensive Forwards and Offensive Backs: The 2013 Season of Manhattan College Women’s Soccer*, Joint Mathematics Meetings, San Antonio, January 2015.
  - Travel partially funded by an MAA grant.

### Conferences Attended
- *Graduate Student Conference in Algebra, Geometry, and Topology*, Temple University, June 2017.
- *Upstate New York Number Theory Conference*, Binghamton University, May 2017.
- *2017 Joint Mathematics Meetings*, Atlanta, GA, January 2017.
- *2015 Joint Mathematics Meetings*, San Antonio, TX, January 2015.

### Research Experience
- During the summer of 2017 I participated in the [Polygonal Billiards Research Cluster][poly research] at Tufts University. This work is still ongoing.
- During the summer of 2014, I participated in the [*Jasper Summer Fellow's* program][fellow]. I analyzed their Women’s Soccer team, the Jaspers, from a Network Theory perspective. This work lead to the following publication:
  - (with H. Tyler) [*Measurement and comparison of passing networks in collegiate soccer.*][paper] Minnesota Journal of Undergraduate Mathematics, [S.l.], v. 1, n. 1, Dec. 2015.
